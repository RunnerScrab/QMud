# QMud RS Fork

This is my fork of QMud, with my own bug fixes (which I will continue to share with upstream in PRs) and the CthuluMUD references removed. QMud is basically MUSHclient with High DPI support and a non-glitchy zMUD style splitter window, which is a potent combination.

If you find issues while using the fork, **please open issues on this fork, not on the upstream project.** If I determine that the issue is from the upstream project, I will try to fix the bug here and offer the patch to the upstream. I don't want the upstream maintainer to deal with problems I make, because he did not volunteer to do that nor should he be expected to.

QMud is a Qt 6 port and continuation of the
original [MUSHclient](https://www.mushclient.com/mushclient/mushclient.htm) (by Nick Gammon),
designed and written by Panagiotis Kalogiratos (Nodens) of [CthulhuMUD](https://www.cthulhumud.com).
It is a client program for connecting to MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) games.
It is compatible with existing MUSHclient files and plugins, but it will migrate them to
its own format in order to maintain separation. As more features are implemented,
things were bound to diverge, especially in data persistence, so, as a conscious
choice, QMud diverges from the get-go.
The active implementation in this repository is C++20 + Qt 6.11.

The official site and documentation of QMud is here: [qmud.dev](https://qmud.dev)

## Project status

The porting has been completed. Behavior aims for high compatibility
with original persistence and Lua workflows while using a modern Qt
implementation. There are several improvements and new features implemented
already. Please use the issue tracker, with the appropriate template to report
issues, request features, etc.

## Features

- Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- Unicode, NAWS, Terminal Type, CHARSET, EOR, ECHO, MXP, MSP, MCCP, MMCP, OSC8, xterm256 color, Truecolor, TLS (Direct &
  Upgrade).
- Lua scripting.
- Copyover-style in-place reload on Linux/macOS (`File -> Reload QMud`).
- Split-pane scrollback buffer, persistent scrollback buffer/command history.
- Autosave, autobackup, log rotation, log compression.
- Autoupdates.

## Contact / Support

For support, testing feedback, and development discussion, join:

- [CthulhuMUD Discord](https://discord.gg/secxwnTJCq)

Do **NOT** use the issue tracker for general support requests.

## Contributions

- Bug fix PRs are welcome.
- Feature PRs have to be discussed first either on Issue tracker or Discord.
- You can also contribute with documentation or translations (once work on both is started; but you can apply to help
  before that)
- You can test plugins of various MUDs and see if they're working right or not. Open detailed issues if something's not
  working including a source for the plugin in question.
- You can also contribute with funding as funds are needed for code signing certificate, Apple registration etc.
  in order to bring QMud to the Apple Store/avoid issues with Windows SmartScreen/WDAC.

NOTICE: While contributions/PRs are very welcome, if you open a PR, you are expected to UNDERSTAND the code you're
touching AND be able to make requested changes after review. "Vibe coding" is NOT welcome.

## Supported platforms

- Linux (primary development platform)
- Windows (source/build support and packaging workflow)
- macOS (source/build support and packaging workflow)

## Migration from MUSHclient data

QMud can migrate an existing MUSHclient data tree on first run. Migration is
copy-based, so source files are preserved and moved under a `migrated` marker
path after successful import to avoid reprocessing.

What is migrated:

- World list/database entries (including plugin list metadata)
- World files under the worlds tree (`.MCL` and related world XML data)
- Preference/state data required for normal startup

Path handling during migration normalizes legacy Windows-style paths (for
example `C:\...`) so migrated worlds resolve correctly on the active platform.

### How to Migrate

1. Install/Run QMud (depending on platform) to create fresh QMud home directory.
2. Copy your MUSHclient's lua contents into QMud/lua directory without overwriting anything. (*IF* you have placed any
   custom lua modules there)
3. Copy your MUSHclient scripts directory into QMud/ directory without overwriting anything. (*IF* you have placed any
   custom scripts there)
4. Copy your MUSHclient world directory into QMud/ without overwriting anything.
5. Delete QMud.conf and QMud.sqlite from QMud/ directory.
6. Copy your mushclient.ini and mushclient_prefs.sqlite to QMud/ directory.
7. Run QMud.
8. Change Terminal Type (TTYPE) in world preferences to "QMud" unless you have a reason to keep it mushclient (e.g. Mud
   does some special handling on TTYPE).
9. (Optional) Do a manual check on your .qdl world files with a text editor to make sure paths have migrated normally.
   QMud saves paths ALWAYS as RELATIVE to the QMUD_HOME directory and with FORWARD slashes even on Windows. So all paths
   in the world file should look like: `<include name="./worlds/plugins/CthulhuMUD/CthulhuMUD_Mapper.xml" plugin="y" />`

Always keep a copy of your original MUSHclient directory. Extensive testing has been done but better safe than sorry.

## Data directory resolution (`QMUD_HOME`)

QMud resolves its startup/data directory in this order:

1. `QMUD_HOME` environment variable (all platforms).
2. If env var is missing, `QMUD_HOME` from config file fallback:
    - Linux: `~/.config/QMud/config`, then `/etc/QMud/config`
    - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/QMud/config`, then `/Library/Application Support/QMud/config`
    - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/QMud/config`

When multi-instance mode is enabled (`QMUD_ALLOW_MULTI_INSTANCE` env var or `--multi-instance`/
`--allow-multi-instance`), config fallback is disabled and `QMUD_HOME` must be set explicitly in the process environment
in order to avoid second instances writing to the same datadir.

System config lines support both:

- `QMUD_HOME=/path/to/dir`
- `export QMUD_HOME=/path/to/dir`

Quoted values are accepted, and leading `~` is expanded.
The same config fallback files can also define any `QMUD_*` environment flag, and those values are used when the real
process environment does not override them.

If nothing is configured, defaults are:

- AppImage: `$HOME/QMud`
- macOS: `~/Documents/QMud`
- Windows and non-AppImage Linux: executable directory

## Environment flags and CLI switches

### Environment flags

Flags below can be provided either as process environment variables or in the OS config fallback files (`QMUD_*`
entries, used as fallback when not set in the process environment).

- `QMUD_HOME`: Overrides startup/data directory resolution (see section above).
- `QMUD_ALLOW_MULTI_INSTANCE`: When set to `1`, `y`, `yes`, or `true`, bypasses single-instance enforcement. (Not safe
  with same datadir). In this mode, `QMUD_HOME` must be explicitly set in process environment.
- `QMUD_DISABLE_UPDATE`:  When set to `1`, `y`, `yes`, or `true`, disables the automatic updates functionality (for
  distro packaging).
- `QMUD_RELOAD_VERBOSE`: When set to `1`, `y`, `yes`, or `true`, enables verbose per-world reload diagnostics in logs.

### CLI switches

- `--multi-instance` (alias: `--allow-multi-instance`): Bypass single-instance enforcement for that process. (Not safe
  with same datadir). In this mode, `QMUD_HOME` must be explicitly set in process environment.
- `--dump-lua-api <output-dir>`: Export Lua API inventory to the given directory and exit.

## Reload QMud (Copyover-style)

`File -> Reload QMud` is available on Linux and macOS. It performs a reload keeping worlds connected when possible.

Current behavior/limitations:

- MCCPv1/2 enabled worlds that do not honor IAC DONT COMPRESS/2, on timeout/failure to end compression stream, downgrade
  to reconnect on reload.
- TLS connected worlds also downgrade to reconnect for the time being.

## Build requirements

- CMake 3.21+
- C++20 compiler
- Qt 6 modules: `Widgets`, `Network`, `Sql`, `PrintSupport`
- Optional Qt 6 module: `Multimedia` (sound; disabled at runtime if missing)
- Optional Qt 6 module: `TextToSpeech` (TTS support; disabled if missing)
- zlib
- Lua 5.4 when `QMUD_ENABLE_LUA_SCRIPTING=ON` (default)
- lua-socket
- lua-json
- lua-lpeg
- lua-sec
- patchelf (for AppImage non-docker target)
- qt6-qtspeech-speechd (and working speech-dispatcher daemon/libspeechd) or qt6-qtspeech-flite (for AppImage non-docker
  target with TTS support)

Docker build images for AppImage/Windows/macOS have everything required for building already staged. The above is for
building natively.

## Build instructions

### Linux (Ninja/Makefiles)

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build cmake-build-release --target QMud -j"$(nproc)"
```

### Linux AppImage package

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-release \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DQMUD_ENABLE_APPIMAGE=ON
cmake --build cmake-build-release --target AppImage -j"$(nproc)"
```

The packaged AppImage is generated under `cmake-build-release/appimage/`.

### Windows (Visual Studio 2022)

```powershell
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-release -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build cmake-build-release --config Release --target QMud
```

### macOS (Ninja/Makefiles)

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build cmake-build-release --target QMud -j"$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
```

### Cross/Docker-build AppImage/Windows/macOS on Linux

Build the cross-build images first:

```bash
docker build -t qmud-appimage-builder:qt6.11 -f tools/docker/appimage-qt611/Dockerfile tools/docker/appimage-qt611
docker build -t qmud-macos-builder:qt6.11 -f tools/docker/macos-qt611/Dockerfile tools/docker/macos-qt611
docker build -t qmud-windows-builder:qt6.11 -f tools/docker/windows-qt611/Dockerfile tools/docker/windows-qt611
```

Configure once (Docker targets are Linux-host only):

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-release \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DQMUD_ENABLE_APPIMAGE=OFF \
  -DQMUD_ENABLE_APPIMAGE_DOCKER=ON \
  -DQMUD_ENABLE_MAC_DOCKER=ON \
  -DQMUD_ENABLE_WINDOCKER=ON \
  -DQMUD_DOCKER_EXECUTABLE=docker
```

Build cross targets:

```bash
cmake --build cmake-build-release --target AppImageDocker
cmake --build cmake-build-release --target MacDockerU
cmake --build cmake-build-release --target WinDocker
```

`MacDockerU` is the default macOS packaging target and produces universal `x86_64`/`arm64` binaries. To build a
single-architecture macOS package manually, use `MacDocker` with `QMUD_MAC_DOCKER_ARCH` set at configure time:

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-release -DQMUD_MAC_DOCKER_ARCH=aarch64
cmake --build cmake-build-release --target MacDocker
```

`QMUD_MAC_DOCKER_ARCH` accepts `x86_64` or `aarch64`.

Notice that Qt is always universal as it is not customly built for QMud.

Artifacts are written to:

- AppImage: `cmake-build-release/appimage-docker-out`
- macOS: `cmake-build-release/mac-docker-out`
- Windows: `cmake-build-release/windows-docker-out`

## Running tests

Configure with tests enabled:

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-release \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DQMUD_ENABLE_TESTING=ON \
  -DQMUD_ENABLE_GUI_TESTS=ON
```

Build and run all registered tests:

```bash
cmake --build cmake-build-release -j"$(nproc)"
ctest --test-dir cmake-build-release --output-on-failure
```

Run the default quick suite used for pull requests:

```bash
ctest --test-dir cmake-build-release --output-on-failure --label-exclude slow
```

CI policy:

- `.github/workflows/pipelines.yml` is the authoritative CI workflow.
- Pull requests should require the `Pipelines / PR/Push quick suite (exclude slow)` and package build jobs to pass
  before merge.

## Purposeful deviations from MUSHclient

These are intentional design choices in QMud:

- Qt-native UI/runtime stack instead of MFC.
- Regex engine uses `QRegularExpression` (PCRE2 behavior).
- XML parsing/serialization uses Qt XML APIs (`QXmlStreamReader`).
- Lua `sqlite3` integration is implemented on top of Qt SQL (`QSqlDatabase`/`QSqlQuery`) via the in-tree Lua binding
  layer.
- Windows Script Host integrations have not been ported; Lua is the ONLY supported scripting engine.
- PNG has been depracated and handled with native Qt.
- Legacy SHS code was deprecated; hashing paths use Qt (`QCryptographicHash`).
- Newly written XML metadata uses `qmud` elements; legacy `muclient` are still read for compatibility.
